## Implementation of Quick Sort
```java
// Java program for implementation of QuickSort 
class QuickSort { 
	/* This function takes last element as pivot, 
	places the pivot element at its correct 
	position in sorted array, and places all 
	smaller (smaller than pivot) to left of 
	pivot and all greater elements to right 
	of pivot */
	int partition(int arr[], int low, int high) { 
		int pivot = arr[high]; 
		int i = (low-1); // index of smaller element 
		for (int j=low; j<high; j++) { 
			// If current element is smaller than or 
			// equal to pivot 
			if (arr[j] <= pivot) { 
				i++; 

				// swap arr[i] and arr[j] 
				int temp = arr[i]; 
				arr[i] = arr[j]; 
				arr[j] = temp; 
			} 
		} 

		// swap arr[i+1] and arr[high] (or pivot) 
		int temp = arr[i+1]; 
		arr[i+1] = arr[high]; 
		arr[high] = temp; 

		return i+1; 
	} 


	/* The main function that implements QuickSort() 
	arr[] --> Array to be sorted, 
	low --> Starting index, 
	high --> Ending index */
	void sort(int arr[], int low, int high) { 
		if (low < high) { 
			/* pi is partitioning index, arr[pi] is 
			now at right place */
			int pi = partition(arr, low, high); 

			// Recursively sort elements before 
			// partition and after partition 
			sort(arr, low, pi-1); 
			sort(arr, pi+1, high); 
		} 
	} 

	/* A utility function to print array of size n */
	static void printArray(int arr[]) { 
		int n = arr.length; 
		for (int i=0; i<n; ++i) 
			System.out.print(arr[i]+" "); 
		System.out.println(); 
	} 

	// Driver program 
	public static void main(String args[]) { 
		int arr[] = {10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5}; 
		int n = arr.length; 

		QuickSort ob = new QuickSort(); 
		ob.sort(arr, 0, n-1); 

		System.out.println("sorted array"); 
		printArray(arr); 
	} 
}

## Analysis
Time taken by QuickSort in general can be written as following.

`T(n) = T(k) + T(n-k-1) + theta(n)`
The first two terms are for two recursive calls, the last term is for the partition process. k is the number of elements which are smaller than pivot.
The time taken by QuickSort depends upon the input array and partition strategy. Following are three cases.

Worst Case: The worst case occurs when the partition process always picks greatest or smallest element as pivot. If we consider above partition strategy where last element is always picked as pivot, the worst case would occur when the array is already sorted in increasing or decreasing order. Following is recurrence for worst case.

`T(n) = T(0) + T(n-1) + theta(n)` which is equivalent to  `T(n) = T(n-1) + theta(n)`

Average Case:
To do average case analysis, we need to consider all possible permutation of array and calculate time taken by every permutation which doesn’t look easy.
We can get an idea of average case by considering the case when partition puts O(n/9) elements in one set and O(9n/10) elements in other set. Following is recurrence for this case.

`T(n) = T(n/9) + T(9n/10) + theta(n)`
Solution of above recurrence is also `O(nLogn)`

Although the worst case time complexity of QuickSort is O(n2) which is more than many other sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort, QuickSort is faster in practice, because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures, and in most real-world data. QuickSort can be implemented in different ways by changing the choice of pivot, so that the worst case rarely occurs for a given type of data. However, merge sort is generally considered better when data is huge and stored in external storage.
