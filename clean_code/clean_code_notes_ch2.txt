# Chapter 2 Meaningful Names

Use intention revealing names and change names when you find better ones. 

implicity of the code:  the degree to which the context is not explicit in the code itself

Avoid disinformation. We should
avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning.

Do not add casual data structures that do not apply, accountList could be misleading if not a list, leave it more generic as accounts. 

Don't write code to only satisfy an interpreter. Use names so that the reader knows what the differences offer.

Use pronounceable names. Use searchable names. 
Longer names trump shorternames, and searchable names trump any constants in code. 

Good measure is that the length of the name should correspond to the size of its scope

Avoid words like Manager, Processor, Data, or Info in the name of a class. A class name should not be a verb.

Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like postPayment, deletePage, or save.
Accessors, mutators, and predicates should be named for their value and prefixed with get,
set, and is according to the javabean standard

Pick one word per concept
