# Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e. any node that is not the head or the tail) of a singly linked list, give only access to that node. 

1 --> 5 --> 9 --> 12. Can you make it look like 1 --> 5 --> 12 if you only have access to 9?

// duplicate next element then delete it.

public boolean removeFromMiddle(Node n){
	if (n == null || n.next == null) return false;
	n.data = n.next.data;
	n.next = n.next.next;
	return true;
}
